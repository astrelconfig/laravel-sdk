Integrate [Astrel](https://astrel.io) to your Laravel applications.

[Astrel](https://astrel.io) is a remote config orchestration application that enables you to change anything in your apps without touching your code.

## Installation

Install this package via composer.

```bash
composer require sustainable-hustle/astrel-laravel
```

And add your Astrel API key in your `.env` file.

```bash
ASTREL_API_KEY="sxjTgBJAxkT2TNyKf9vabFI0L07AyItM5o3iiloS"
```

Optionally, publish the `astrel` config file.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="astrel-config"
```

## Basic usage

This package provides a facade you can use to retrieve one or many aspects. An aspect is a key/value pair that you configure and updates directly on your Astrel dashboard.

``` php
use SustainableHustle\Astrel\Facades\Astrel;

Astrel::all();                        // Returns all aspects.
Astrel::get('slug');                  // Returns the value of an aspect by giving its slug.
Astrel::get('slug', 'default value'); // Returns the default value if the given aspect has no value.
```

Alternatively, you may use the `astrel` helper method to access the Astrel manager or to access a value directly.

``` php
astrel()->all();                 // Equivalent to Astrel::all();
astrel('slug');                  // Equivalent to Astrel::get('slug');
astrel('slug', 'default value'); // Equivalent to Astrel::get('slug', 'default value');
```

## Caching

This package automatically caches all retrieved aspects. This ensure your application does not make API calls every single time a value from Astrel is required.

You may use the `flush` and `refetch` methods from the `Astrel` facade to clear the cache as well as refetching its content immediately.

``` php
use SustainableHustle\Astrel\Facades\Astrel;

Astrel::flush()   // Flush the cache for all aspects.
Astrel::refetch() // Flush the cache and refetch all aspects immediately.
```

By default, the cache never expires meaning you will have to manually flush it when necessary. This is because Astrel will send you a webhook whenever something changes so you can flush the cache only when necessary (see section below).

However, if you'd like to customize the cache's lifetime, you may update the `cache_lifetime` variable in your `config/astrel.php` file.

## Clear the cache when receiving a webhook

As mentioned above, you can configure Astrel to send you a webhook whenever any value gets updated. That means you can use this webhook to clear and immediately refetch all of your aspects.

This package provides a helper method `webhookRoute` on the `Astrel` facade that does just that. Simply add this to your routes file and chain any route configuration you might like.

``` php
use SustainableHustle\Astrel\Facades\Astrel;

Astrel::webhookRoute()                  // Register a route that calls `Astrel::refetch()` when triggered.
Astrel::webhookRoute('webhooks/astrel') // Provide a custom path to that route.
Astrel::webhookRoute('webhooks/astrel') // This method returns a Route object so you can chain anything you want.
    ->name('webhooks.astrel')
    ->middleware('web')
```
